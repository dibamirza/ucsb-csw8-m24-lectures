# ZyLabs 4.11 and 4.12 (Accumulator pattern)

# Nested Loops, practice problems with ASCII Art
# # 1. Draw a rectangle, given its width and height
# # 2. Draw the letter C, given its width and height


# 1. Write a function that returns a rectangle of *'s', given its width and height
def getRectangle(width, height):
  '''returns a string representing a 
     rectangle of *s with given width and height'''
  return ""


print(getRectangle(3, 4))


# 2. Write a function that returns a string representing the letter C, given its width and height
def getC(width, height):
  '''returns a string representing the letter C 
     using *s with given width and height'''
  pass
